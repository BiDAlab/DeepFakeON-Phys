# DeepFakesON-Phys: DeepFakes Detection based on Heart Rate Estimation

![Header](images/diagrama1.png)

## Overview
DeepFakesON-Phys is DeepFake detection framework based on physiological measurement. In particular, it considers
information related to the heart rate using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). 
DeepFakesON-Phys uses a Convolutional Attention Network (CAN), which extracts spatial and temporal information from video frames, analyzing and combining both sources to better detect fake videos. 

DeepFakesONPhys has been experimentally evaluated using the latest public databases in the field: Celeb-DF and DFDC. The results
achieved, above 98% AUC (Area Under the Curve) on both databases, outperform the state of the art and prove the success of fake detectors based on physiological measurement to detect the latest DeepFake videos.
